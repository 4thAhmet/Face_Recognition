# Face Recognition

Face detection and recognition with Python and OPENCV

Hello everyone, The easiest way to detect face is to use Haar Cascades. You can get some additional information from the OpenCV homepage, see. Cascade Classifier page. To train your own cascade classifier, see also. Stepped Classifier Training.



## Run it on your computer

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/4thAhmet/Face_Recognition
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Face_Recognition
```

Gerekli paketleri y√ºkleyin

```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install numpy
  pip install Pillow
```

Run the Data_Set.py. Take a picture of faces to be recognized and save

```bash
  python Data_Set.py or python3 Data_Set.py
```
Run the Train.py. Train saved images and generate yml file

```bash
  python Train.py or python3 Train.py
```

Run the Face_Detect.py. Get started
```bash
  python Face_Detect.py or python3 Face_Detect.py
```


## What did I learn?

This project was done in the learning phase. With this project, I learned the Haar Cascade classifier and performed the face recognition process.
I learned how to use the opencv library and how to make operations on the image.
